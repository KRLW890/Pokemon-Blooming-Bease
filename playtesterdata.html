<li>Each area entered
<li>Each wild Pokemon encountered, along with its level and result (this includes when a Pokemon is captured)
<li>Each trainer battled, along with the result
<li>The Pokemon in your party and their levels at specific points
<li>Each overworld item obtained, along with items from NPCs
<li>Each time healed and where
<li>Each time interacting with a shop and where
<li>Each in-game trade
<li>Riding in minecarts
<li>Character conversation options selected
<li>Each time saved along with the version number and in-game play time
<li>Each time the game is loaded, along with the version number
</ul>
These allow the developer to reconstruct the playtester's experience in lieu of being able to watch.<br>
