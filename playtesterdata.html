Pokemon Blooming Beast automatically records information, such as the results of your battles, into the file "playtesterdata.txt". For transparency, an exhaustive list of the information recorded is provided here:
<ul>
<li>Starter Pokemon choice,<br>
<li>Each area entered,<br>
<li>Each wild Pokemon encountered, along with its level and result (this includes captured Pokemon),<br>
<li>Each trainer battled, along with the result,<br>
<li>The levels of your Pokemon at specific points,<br>
<li>Each overworld item obtained, along with items from NPCs,<br>
<li>Each time healed and where,<br>
<li>Each time interacting with a shop and where,<br>
<li>Each in-game trade,<br>
<li>Each time saved along with the version number and in-game play time,<br>
<li>And each time the game is loaded, along with the version number.
</ul>
These allow the developer to reconstruct the playtester's experience in lieu of being able to watch.<br>
Anything not expressly listed above is not recorded.<br><br>
Submitting the playtester.txt file is not required in the playtester survey, but it is recommended.<br><br>
Thank you for playing Pokemon Blooming Beast.<br>
